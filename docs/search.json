    "text": "About me\nHello, my name is Lulu Singer! I was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but grew up all over the place. Much to my delight, my education has since brought me back to my hometown. I’m passionate about data analysis, parasites, and accesible science. In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, listening to music (especially live!), and watching MMA.\n\n\nResearch interests\nI conducted my master’s research in the Mugnier Lab at BSPH, where I studied the antibody response to the antigenically variable Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) in African trypanosomes. During my time in the lab, I really enjoyed being able to combine my interests in neglected tropical diseases, immunology, and bioinformatics. I hope to continue a career applying computational approaches to studying host-parasite interactions, parasite biology, and popultion genomics.\n\n\nEducation\n\nBS Biology, George Mason University, December 2021\nScM Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, May 2024\nPhD Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Current\n\n\n\nFavorites\n\n\n\nFavorite…\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals\nFrogs, Snails\n\n\nFoods\nIce cream, dumplings\n\n\nFighters\nZhang Weili, Max Holloway\n\n\nMovies\nThe Iron Giant, Lilo and Stitch\n\n\nTV Shows\nAdventure Time, Over the Garden Wall"

    "text": "Is the decrease in KO/TKO frequency correlated with the introduction of the new gloves?\nLooking at the data for UFC cards from 2010-2024, KO/TKO frequency hovers around an average of ~31.9% (sd = 13.9) (Figure 3). While KO/TKO frequency has been decreasing recently, the decrease doesn’t appear to be correlated with the introduction of the new gloves (June 1, 2024) or outside the normal range of variation.\n\n\nCode\npct_ave &lt;- mean(pct_kotko$pct_kotko)\npct_sd &lt;- sd(pct_kotko$pct_kotko)\n\npct_kotko %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = pct_kotko))+\n        geom_line(alpha = 0.2)+\n        geom_smooth(method = stats::loess, se = F, method.args = list(degree = 0, span = 0.03))+\n        geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(\"2024-06-01\"), color = \"red\", lty = 2)+\n        geom_hline(yintercept = pct_ave)+\n        scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\",date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n        xlab(\"Card date\")+\n        ylab(\"Percent of fights ending in a KO/TKO\")+\n        labs(title = \"Percent of fights on a UFC card ending in a ko/tko over time\",subtitle = \"New gloves implemented (red line); 2010-2024 average (black line)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Percent of fights on a card ending in a knock out or technical knockout over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn important factor to consider is that some fighter’s are more likely to get a KO/TKO than others. For example, fighters may have a more striking vs grappling heavy style, strikers may prefer “head hunting” to volume striking, and “knock out power” can also vary greatly by individual and weight class. As a result, we might expect some cards to have fewer KO/TKOs anyway based on the styles of the fighters on the card. To try to account for this, we can approximate how many KO/TKO’s we would expect per fight card given how frequently the winners’ historically have won by KO/TKO.\n\n\n\n\nCode\np_kotko &lt;- ufc_data %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        # Proportion of red wins by ko/tko\n        p_red_kotko = (RedWinsByKO + RedWinsByTKODoctorStoppage)/RedWins,\n        # Proportion of blue wins by ko/tko\n        p_blue_kotko = (BlueWinsByKO + BlueWinsByTKODoctorStoppage)/BlueWins,\n        # Fight expected kotko based on winner\n        p_kotko = case_when(Winner == \"Red\" ~ p_red_kotko, Winner == \"Blue\" ~ p_blue_kotko)\n        ) %&gt;%\n    # Filter out fights where p_kotko is NA\n    filter(!is.na(p_kotko)) %&gt;%\n    # Summarize by card\n    group_by(Date) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        # Number of fights during this period\n        n = n(),\n        # Observed proportion of ko/tko's\n        obs_kotko = sum(kotko)/n,\n        # Expected proportion of ko/tko's\n        exp_kotko = sum(p_kotko)/n\n    ) %&gt;%\n    mutate(# Difference between observed and expected\n        delta_kotko = (obs_kotko - exp_kotko))\n\n\nThis method for calculating “expected” KO/TKO frequency is likely sufficient considering that the average difference between observed and expected from 2010-2024 was essentially 0 (mean = -0.01, sd =0.19). Looking the difference between observed and expected KO/TKO frequencies over time, we see a similar downward trend starting in late 2023 that doesn’t seem particularly abnormal.\n\n\nCode\np_ave &lt;- mean(p_kotko$delta_kotko)\np_sd &lt;- sd(p_kotko$delta_kotko)\n\np_kotko %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = delta_kotko))+\n        geom_line(alpha = 0.2)+\n        geom_smooth(method = stats::loess, se = F, method.args = list(degree = 0, span = 0.03))+\n        geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(\"2024-06-01\"), color = \"red\", lty = 2)+\n        geom_hline(yintercept = p_ave)+\n        scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\",date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n        xlab(\"Card date\")+\n        ylab(\"observed - expected KO/TKO frequency\")+\n        labs(title = \"Difference between observed and expected ko/tko frequency\",subtitle = \"New gloves implemented June 1, 2024 (red line); 2010-2024 average (black line)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Difference between observed and expected ko/tko frequency per card over time."
